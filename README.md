# MITM Attack on Diffieâ€“Hellman (FC421 Applied Cryptography â€“ Fall 2025)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project Illustrate the vulnerability of the **Diffieâ€“Hellman (DH) key exchange** to a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack** when authentication element is missing.
It covers the following components:

- A simple clientâ€“server chat system (Eddie â†” Venom) establishing a symmetric key using DH and encrypt messages with AES.
- An attacker (Mallory) positions himself as a proxy, intercepting both of exchange and creating separate keys with each party. This able him to read or modify messages.
- A defense mechanism can be implemented by adding **RSA digital signatures** to authenticate the DH values, avoiding Mallory from performing a successful attack.

This project is developed as part of **FC421 Applied Cryptography â€“ Fall 2025** at the UPM AKA University of Prince Mugrin.
